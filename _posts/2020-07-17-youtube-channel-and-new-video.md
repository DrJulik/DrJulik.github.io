## I have started a youtube channel!

While the channel is mostly for me and solidifying my grasp on some WebDev concepts, I also want to help some people out there, who may struggle with the same things that I struggle with all the time. So if any of my videos will help at least one person... I say mission complete!

### Here is the first video! On setting up Strapi with MongoDb Atlas!

_Keep learning!_

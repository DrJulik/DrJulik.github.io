It has been mentioned to me several times by several people that having a place where people can view your written work is incredibly important. When I first started getting into web-design the prospect of sharing my thoughts and knowledge (what knowledge?) seemed like a scary prospect. While I always wanted to have a place where I could share my articles and essays, I was reluctant to write about topics that I knew a lot less about. But then a thought occurred to me: Aren't we, as web-designers and developers constantly learning? There are always going to be people who know more and those who less and if any of my small articles will be of help to anyone, the goal will be fulfilled. The next post will feature actual web-dev content. I promise.

I'm sitting here in the middle of July with a bit of a fever and a really strong headache. I won't lie, this headache is brought to me at least partially by the last couple of hours of figuring out how to set up Jekyll and make it bend to my will. If you are reading this...WHO ARE YOU AND WHY ARE YOU SPYING ON ME? I set up this blog as an attempt to share knowledge WHILE learning this web-design/development stuff myself. I hope I can help someone out there, while I am helping myself.

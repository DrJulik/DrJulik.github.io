&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first started getting into Wordpress, one of the major things that I could not wrap my head around was the process of setting up my Wordpress locally. I knew that having a local environment setup had so many advantages, compared to just working online, but my lack of knowledge about servers and any related software was a little discouraging. Thankfully, now beginners have the ability to quickly set up their local Wordpress environment with [Local by Flywheel](https://localbyflywheel.com). In this article I will give you a quick rundown of some of the main features of this fabulous piece of software.

- ## The speed and simplicity

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Local, you don’t have to setup WAMP/MAMP/XAMP or any other server configuration software. All you have to do is download the client from their website and install it! It’s going to automatically start up the local machine, presenting you with this view.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From here we click the Create the Site button, give it a name and give it a custom (local) site domain and path. Now we are ready to customize our environment, and here is where Local starts showing its simplicity AND versatility. You can choose your PHP version, web server (nginx or Apache) and MySQL version. Set up your username and password and BOOM… You are done!

- ## More Cool (and easy) stuff! (SSL and Plugins)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going through the tabs on the local sites screen, we uncover even more amazing stuff!
In overview and database you have all the info about your server and databases, some of which you can change right there. The SSL tab gives us the ability to, surprise-surprise, hook up your local site to an SSL certificate, so you can emulate even that part of your website.
Local also comes with community developed Add-ons, for even smoother workflow. There are plugins for notes, port forwarding, debugging and so much more. Plus, if you’re interested, you can try creating your own plugins for Local!

- ## Some more amazing stuff… (Live Link)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the bottom of your site view there is a handy little button called live link, which enables you to share your Wordpress website with other people super quickly, without hosting it! After you enable the Live Link, Local will autogenerate you a link that can be accessed by other people. This is perfect for when you want to share your current work with a client. A word of caution: As soon as you close your laptop or Local, the Live Link will turn off and your client won’t be able to see the site anymore. Also, the URL changes every time you re-enable the Live Link.
